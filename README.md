# The aim

The aim of this repo is to collect all the possibilities to write "hello world" in all programming languages ([on github](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml))


# Contributing

if you want to add one hello world in a language who is not in this repo

you must respect 3 rules :

 - create a new dir with the name of the programming language 
 - add a code file with the right extension **ONLY** (for example : for a compiled language , do not put the binary file)
 - add a `readme.md` to explain how to run the script and link of the language (you can see an example [here](/Python/Readme.md))

# Thanks

Thanks to all the people who already contributed!
